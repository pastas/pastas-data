# README

This dataset is contains data from two articles.

## Wagna
These groundwater level time series for the hydrological research station Wagna in Austria were obtained from the government of Styria in cooperation with JR-AquaConsol (https://www.jr-aquaconsol.at/). We acknowledge JR-AquaConsol for providing the time series and allowing its use in this example. This data may not be redistributed without explicit permission from JR-AquaConsol.

These precipitation time series were obtained from the gridded E-OBS database (Cornes et al.,2018; v22.0e). We acknowledge the E-OBS dataset from the EU-FP6 project UERRA (https://www.uerra.eu) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the data providers in the ECA&D project (https://www.ecad.eu).

These potential Makking evaporation time series were obtained from the gridded E-OBS database (Cornes et al.,2018; v22.0e). We acknowledge the E-OBS dataset from the EU-FP6 project UERRA (https://www.uerra.eu) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service, and the data providers in the ECA&D project (https://www.ecad.eu).

## Irregular Timesteps
This dataset is a special one, as it does not contain any stresses or heads. Instead it contains the irregular time stamps from 1000 real head time series. This can be used to select measurements with an irregular time step from any set of regular time series.
